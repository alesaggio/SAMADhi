SAMADhi
=======

SAmple MAnagement Database

Samādhi in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and yogic schools is a higher level of concentrated meditation, or dhyāna. In the yoga tradition, it is the eighth and final limb identified in the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali.

This project is to develop a database to keep track of samples used by our group for CMS data analysis,
and to record event weights generated by MadWeight jobs. 

A python interface is provided via the STORM package.

Setup inside a CMSSW project area:
```
cmsrel $MY_CMSSW_VERSION

cd $MY_CMSSW_VERSION/src
cmsenv
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/cp3-llbb/SAMADhi.git cp3_llbb/SAMADhi
```

Standalone setup on ingrid:
```
source installpy_standalone.sh
```
this will create an install tree and symlink if needed, and otherwise only set some environment variables.
